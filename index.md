## About Me

I'm currently in my fourth year of studying for my Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
I'm fortunate to have [Professor Hongjing Lu](https://cvl.psych.ucla.edu/people/) as my advisor. Before starting my 
Ph.D., I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 
under the guidance of [Professor Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/). I also had the pleasure of spending a fantastic 
year in the [CCVL lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, working under the mentorship of 
[Professor Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). 
Additionally, I gained valuable experience during my time at [Google X](https://x.company/) and [Mineral.ai](https://mineral.ai/).


## Research Interests

My research focuses on merging <strong>machine learning</strong> and 
<strong>cognitive science</strong> to enhance <strong>relational reasoning</strong> 
and <strong>visual analogy</strong> in AI models. I investigate how humans perceive 
and reason about relationships and analogies, with the goal of imbuing AI systems with 
similar cognitive abilities. Through empirical studies and 
computational modeling, I bridge the gap between human intelligence and artificial 
intelligence. I hope to contribute to creating more interpretable, robust, and 
adaptable AI systems while advancing our understanding of human cognition.
