## About Me

I am a 4-th year Psychology Ph.D. student at University of California - Los Angeles, 
where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Hongjing Lu. Prior to joining the Ph.D. 
program, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Hong Kong University
of Science and Technology, advised by Professor Qifeng Chen. I also spent a wonderful year
in CCVL lab at Johns Hopkins University advised by Professor Alan L. Yuille. 
I spent great times at Google X and Mineral.ai.


## Research Interests

My research focuses on merging <strong>machine learning</strong> and 
<strong>cognitive science</strong> to enhance <strong>relational reasoning</strong> 
and <strong>visual analogy</strong> in AI models. I investigate how humans perceive 
and reason about relationships and analogies, with the goal of imbuing AI systems with 
similar cognitive abilities. Through empirical studies and 
computational modeling, I bridge the gap between human intelligence and artificial 
intelligence. I hope to contribute to creating more interpretable, robust, and 
adaptable AI systems while advancing our understanding of human cognition.
